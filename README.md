# RedAshes
RedAshes is a turn-based RPG, Rogue-like game coded in C++.
The project is a beginning state. We are currently coding basic algorithms and soon we will start commiting the codebase

The goal of the project is coding a game entirely based on random generation algorithms for floors, levels, enemies and final bosses.
Currently we are focusing on basic game logic. For that reason, we don't know what type of graphical engine or API we are going to use.

The project branch called "stagingbranch" is currently used for WIP code. It's provided with a dummy main that can give you an idea of 
a randomly generated dungeon floor. It's fully functional and can be compiled using qmake (Qt tool for Makefile generation). Currenly i'm
working on the path generation algorithm and, as soon as i'm finished, this branch will be merged with the master branch.
