# RedAshes
RedAshes is a turn-based RPG, Rogue-like game coded in C++.
The project is a beginning state. We are currently coding basic algorithms and soon we will start commiting the codebase

The goal of the project is coding a game entirely based on random generation algorithms for floors, levels, enemies and final bosses.
Currently we are focusing on basic game logic. For that reason, we don't know what type pf graphical engine or API we are going to use.
